# TODO

## Requesting information:
- [x] Weather
- [x] Reddit
- [ ] Twitter
- [ ] Getting sources
- [ ] Imgur
- [ ] League of Legends (Riot)
- [ ] Stock and cryptocoin information
- [ ] Playback from videos
- [ ] Plotting
- [ ] Osu!

## Current objectives:
* Let cogs.rankers.messages find the databases
* Have comms.Bot have many attributes to activate requesters, instead of having way too many background tasks
* Settle on a way to present information
* Have a website for the changelog

## Future objectives:
* Customized commands created through discord messages that are put into separate folder
* Add permissions to the bot, so multiple people can have access to high-level commands
* Recreate the help command for all commands including hidden ones
* Make Warframe requester only have two commands, help and get.
* Creates, saves, and edits checklists requested by users
* Get Riot developer token
* Finish the calculator for plotting
* Quality Of Life command creations
* Playback Youtube videos as mp3
* 2FA for owner with a cooldown
* Text to speech through bot
