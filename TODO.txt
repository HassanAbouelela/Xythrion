TODO Cogs:
- weather
- warframe
- tts
- graphing
- UNO
- Pokemon?

- README:
    - Add all the commands, stick with v2.0. The version will not change from here.
    - Make sure that the changelog is actually documented and learn systematic versioning.
    - Maybe in the future tell people how to set up this bot? (probably not for a while)

- Final goal:
    - Use GalaxyGate to host the bot.
    - Send data to local server instead of keeping it on the cloud.
    - Use gitpy to update cogs every once in a while, or with commands.
    - Everything will be automated, and nothing will need to be touched after deployment (unless there's an update).
