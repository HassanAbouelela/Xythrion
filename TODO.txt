TODO Cogs:
- graphing: Graph simple equations, then work up to integrals (matplotlib for graphing, regex for parsing).
- reminder (tts): Get reminders working. If author is in voice chat, join, tell them, leave.
- UNO: May be really hard because of gamestate storage, maybe this should use its own database.
- Imgur/Youtube: Get post information
- Minecraft: Rescipes (if possible)

- README:
    - Add all the commands, stick with v2.0. The version will not change from here.
    - Make sure that the changelog is actually documented and learn systematic versioning.
    - Maybe in the future tell people how to set up this bot? (probably not for a while)
    - Make it so everything can collapse, so it's small at first, but very deep when it's uncollapsed.

- Final goal:
    - Use GalaxyGate to host the bot.
    - Send data to local server instead of keeping it on the cloud.
    - Use gitpy to update cogs every once in a while, or with commands.
    - Everything will be automated, and nothing will need to be touched after deployment (unless there's an update).
