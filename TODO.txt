- Cogs:
    - Weather: Use OpenWeatherMap forecasting to create graphs and maybe tables.
    - Math: Convert between units and solve equations for user.
    - Graphing: Use matplotlib to create graphs after parsing input with regex. 
    - Admin: Make sure automation of punishment is easier

- Cog ideas:
    - Pokemon: Using equations, calculate chances of things.
    - Minecraft: Get images of crafting, and chances of stuff.

- Website:
    - Start/finish? (idk might not since there isn't a real purpose for it.)

- README:
    - Add all the commands, stick with v2.0. The version will not change from here.
    - Make sure that the changelog is actually documented and learn systematic versioning.
    - Maybe in the future tell people how to set up this bot? (probably not for a while)

- Final goal:
    - Use GalaxyGate to host the bot.
    - Send data to local server instead of keeping it on the cloud.
    - Use gitpy to update cogs every once in a while, or with commands.
    - Everything will be automated, and nothing will need to be touched after deployment (unless there's an update).
