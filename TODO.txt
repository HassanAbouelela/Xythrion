- Cogs:
    - In general:
        - Make sure that all commands that need limiting have rate limiters.
    - Requesters:
        - Weather: Using OpenWeatherMap, make graphs and stuff from it.
        - Graphing: Make a wrapper so graphing is easier and code isn't repeated.
    - Moderation:
        - Make sure warnings can warn user of anything.
        - Set up messages for moderation/safety.
    - Extra:
        - Polish up info for more info.
        - Make links accessable via database (make sure you can't lose the database either).

- Website:
    - Start/finish? (idk might not since there isn't a real purpose for it.)

- README:
    - Add all the commands, stick with v2.0. The version will not change from here.
    - Make sure that the changelog is actually documented and learn systematic versioning.
    - Maybe in the future tell people how to set up this bot? (probably not for a while)

- Overall:
    - Comment everything, everywhere. Make sure everything is documented. There's literally a google-formatting file that's there for a purpose.
    - No backdoors.
